# enzyme

No-nonsense, universal file converter using ffmpeg.wasm.

Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## TODO

- IndexedDB storage limits. Don't store file data in indexedDB.
- Store only file paths?
- Allow cancellation of conversion
- Display recent conversions from dexie
- Global settings to toggle things like showing output stream from ffmpeg
- Sound effects ???
- Type all available extensions?
- Different browsers support return different mimetypes.
