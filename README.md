# enzyme

No-nonsense, universal file converter using ffmpeg.wasm.

Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## TODO

- Show current progress of conversion and the file loaded in the UI
- Allow cancellation of conversion
- Allow multiple files to be converted at once
- Display recent conversions from dexie
- Add a validation to reject multiple file extensions (only one file extension allowed)
- Allow multiple file extensions
- Global settings to toggle things like showing output stream from ffmpeg
- Sound effects ???
- Type all available extensions?
- Different browsers support return different mimetypes.
