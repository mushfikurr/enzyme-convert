No-nonsense, universal file converter using ffmpeg.wasm.

Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## TODO

- Deploy on netlify
- Add file reading with react-dropzone & ffmpeg.wasm
- Make extensions react to file type, only showing allowed filetypes
- Global settings to toggle things like showing output stream from ffmpeg
- Sound effects ???
