Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## TODO
- Implement dexie
- Add a validation to reject multiple file extensions (only one file extension allowed)
- Allow multiple file extensions
- Global settings to toggle things like showing output stream from ffmpeg
- Sound effects ???
- Type all available extensions?
- Different browsers support return different mimetypes.
